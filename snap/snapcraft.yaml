summary: K9s - Kubernetes CLI To Manage Your Clusters In Style!
description: |
  K9s provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters.
  The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and
  manage your applications in the wild. K9s continually watches
  Kubernetes for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with
  your observed resources.

  This is an unofficial build of k9s. I made this because I like snaps,
  I just found k9s and liked it and the snap "k9s" is old.
